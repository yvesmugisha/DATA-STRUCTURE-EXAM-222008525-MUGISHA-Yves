 This is my work of C++

The followings , are the descriptions of the provided outputs:

Output - example 1 :  "Hello, World!" is displayed using the cout statement from the <iostream> library. 
                      This confirms that the program runs successfully and prints text to the console. 
                      It is a basic example of C++ output functionality.
                      
Output - example 2 : This C++ program outputs details for a person: Name (Alice), Age (20), Price ($19.99), and Grade (A).

Output - example 3 : This C++ program prompts the user to input their name and age.
                    It then displays a greeting message, "Hello, MUGISHA! You are 22 years old.
                    
Output - example 4 : This C++ program calculates and displays the sum (13), difference (7), product (30), quotient (3), and remainder (1) of two numbers.
